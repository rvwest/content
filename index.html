        <h2>Why good content is important</h2>


        <p>Good content is inclusive and accessible to all.</p>

        <p>Poor content excludes those who don't know the jargon, don't know where to find it, or just don't have the
          time to understand it.</p>



        <p>I can help you reach the right people, make it as easy as possible for them to find what they need, and
          ultimately make your users happier.</p>

        <h2>About me - Richard West</h2>

        <p>For over 20 years I've worked with universities, charities, business, central and local government to improve
          the experience of their users.</p>

        <p>Most recently I helped to establish content strategy and governance in the newly formed <a
            href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency">UK Health Security Agency
            (UKHSA)</a>.</p>

        <p>During the pandemic I was brought into NHS Test and Trace to tackle issues they were having with
          content. I worked with stakeholders from across government and the NHS to get a shared understanding of the
          issues - and to build processes, teams and attitudes to address them.</p>

        <p>I was digital content and UX manager at the education technology charity <a
            href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk">Jisc</a>. I helped make user
          experience a core principle for the charity. I also established and managed their central content design team.
        </p>

        <p>I have spoken at <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/28000">TEDxJisc</a>, <a
            href="https://iwmw.org">IWMW</a> and <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/digifest">Digifest</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm based in Bristol in the South West. I also love to climb, bake and run.</p>
